## Setup

You will need an api key to use the program.

You can get it from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey 
with https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup for guidance.

Use Replit's secrets tool to add your api key with the key as `api_key`

That's the only set up required.

## How to use

You **must** use the shell to run generator.py, the repl is configured to run main.py to make it easy for you to run your code for the lesson. It is not configured to generate the lessons when you click the run button.

1. Open the shell

2. Type `python generator.py` and press Enter.

3. When asked what is your request
Enter what you would like the ai generated lesson to be about.
You can enter something like `print function` or `math libraries` or `introduction to selenium`

4. After a moment a markdown file is generated and saved in the .tutorial folder with the name as the current date and time. A message telling you where to find the lesson is shown in the console. 
Locate the file and open it, or use the tutorial tool instead.

5. Write your code in main.py and run it with the run button. When you are finished with the lesson, if you want to save your work you should rename the file to something recognizable, and move it into the MyCodes folder, and then create a new main.py file to work on your next lesson.
